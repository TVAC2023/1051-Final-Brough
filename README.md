NOTICE - I could not upload the ambience drone as the file was too long. This is used to demonstrate in the video but any audio file will work with this plug-in. 

I initially attempted to use JUCE for this project, but I found it quite complicated and decided to steer away from it. Eventually, I stumbled upon MAX, a program I am somewhat familiar with. My original goal was to build a reverb plugin, but I encountered significant challenges. While I could easily create a basic reverb plugin, adding features like a Dry/Wet knob and an equalizer for the reverb proved to be much more difficult than I had anticipated.

I still wanted to make a guitar pedal-style plugin so, I decided to focus on a phaser and flanger instead. This shift led to much greater success, and I was able to achieve all of my goals. The Dry/Wet control was still the most challenging aspect, particularly when it came to properly mixing the signals. However, I eventually discovered a method that worked.

My favorite part of the project was the flanger add-on, as I feel it closely resembles a legitimate guitar pedal.
